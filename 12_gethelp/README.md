# Need Help? Options for Getting Help with Research Computing

## Research Computing Website

We recommend first checking out Research Computing's [Knowledge Base](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base) articles on various cluster topics, as well as Research Computing's [FAQ](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/faq). 

If neither resource answers your question(s), Research Computing's website is optimized for search, and we recommend [searching Research Computing's website](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/search/node).

## Submit a Support Ticket

If searching [Research Computing's website](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/) fails, then [submit a support ticket](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/submit-ticket) by emailing cses-AT-princeton-DOT-edu.

## Request In-Person Help Through a Help Session

Most issues can be addressed via a support ticket, but when a one-on-one Zoom meeting is needed, a [Help Session](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/help-sessions) can be requested. Please include detailed information in your request since Research Computing will attempt to resolve all Help Session requests by email before scheduling an appointment.

The above information is also summarized on our [Support](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support) page.
