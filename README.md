# Getting Started with the Research Computing Clusters

## About
This guide presents an overview of using the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems at Princeton. Specifically, it explains how to use Nobel, Adroit, Della, Tiger, Stellar, and Traverse. The visualization machine and file storage system are also covered.

## Prerequisites

This workshop assumes that you have some knowledge of Linux and the Bash command line. To learn these skills see [this guide](https://github.com/gabeclass/introlinux).

In particular, it's helpful to be able to edit basic files on a Linux system (such as Adroit).  A simple text editor for this purpose found on almost all Linux systems is [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/).
